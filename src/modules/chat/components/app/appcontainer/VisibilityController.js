/**
 * This module would normally handle visibility controls for the chat UI,
 * but the critical toggleChatVisibility function has been kept in the 
 * AppContainer.js class to maintain its original context and behavior.
 * 
 * In a future refactoring, additional visibility-related functionality 
 * could be placed here if needed.
